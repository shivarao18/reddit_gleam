## Architecture Benefits from Gleam/OTP

### Actor Model Advantages:
1. **Isolation**: Each component is an independent actor with its own state
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Supervisors restart failed actors automatically
3. **Concurrency**: Thousands of lightweight processes run concurrently
4. **Message Passing**: No shared state, all communication via messages

### OTP Supervisor Tree:
```
Engine Supervisor (one_for_one)
├── User Registry Actor
├── Subreddit Manager Actor
├── Post Manager Actor
├── Comment Manager Actor
├── DM Manager Actor
├── Karma Calculator Actor
└── Feed Generator Actor
```

### Distribution Strategy:
- Engine runs as single Erlang node
- Multiple client simulator nodes connect via Erlang distribution
- Native actor-to-actor messaging across nodes
- No need for HTTP/REST in Part I
