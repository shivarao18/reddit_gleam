# Reddit Clone Part I - Project Summary

## Overview

This project implements a fully functional Reddit-like social platform engine and client simulator using Gleam and OTP. The system leverages the actor model for concurrent, fault-tolerant operation.

## What Was Built

### Core Engine (7 Actors)

1. **User Registry Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/user_registry.gleam`)
   - User registration with unique usernames
   - User state management (karma, subscriptions, online status)
   - Connection/disconnection tracking

2. **Subreddit Manager Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/subreddit_manager.gleam`)
   - Create, join, and leave subreddits
   - Member tracking and counts
   - Subreddit metadata management

3. **Post Manager Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/post_manager.gleam`)
   - Text post creation in subreddits
   - Upvote/downvote functionality
   - Vote tracking per user
   - Score calculation

4. **Comment Manager Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/comment_manager.gleam`)
   - Hierarchical comment structure (comments on comments)
   - Comment voting
   - Parent-child relationship tracking

5. **Direct Message Manager Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/dm_manager.gleam`)
   - DM sending between users
   - Reply functionality
   - Conversation history retrieval

6. **Karma Calculator Actor** (`src/reddit/engine/karma_calculator.gleam`)

### Client Simulator (4 Components)

1. **User Simulator Actor** (`src/reddit/client/user_simulator.gleam`)
   - Simulates individual user behavior
   - Performs posts, comments, votes, DMs
   - Manages user lifecycle

2. **Activity Coordinator** (`src/reddit/client/activity_coordinator.gleam`)
   - Orchestrates simulation activities
   - Distributes activities across subreddits
   - Configurable activity probabilities

3. **Zipf Distribution Generator** (`src/reddit/client/zipf.gleam`)
   - Models realistic subreddit popularity
   - Power-law distribution implementation
   - Sampling and probability functions

4. **Metrics Collector Actor** (`src/reddit/client/metrics_collector.gleam`)
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Throughput measurement (ops/sec)
   - Latency tracking
   - Comprehensive reporting
